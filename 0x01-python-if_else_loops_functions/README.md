## 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This directory contains completed tasks for if/else, loops, and functions, which was project for ALXSE Month #3.
------------------------------

### Task 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
+ This program generates a random signed number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero. The program assigns a different random value to the variable number each time the program is executed.
+ File: `0-positive_or_negative.py`
-----------------------------

### Task 1. The last digit
+ This program generates a random signed number and assigns it to the variable "number" each time it is executed. The provided source code is complete and should not be modified. The assigned value to the 
variable "number" will vary with each program run.
---------------------

### Task 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
+ This program adheres to specific constraints to print the ASCII alphabet in lowercase without new lines. It utilizes a single print function with string formatting and incorporates only one loop in the code. 
The program strictly follows the guidelines, prohibiting the storage of characters in variables and the use of any imported modules.
-------------------------------

### Task 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
+ This program is designed to print the lowercase ASCII alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e,' without new lines. The implementation adheres to specific constraints, including the use of only one print 
function with string formatting, a single loop in the code, and the prohibition of storing characters in variables or importing any modules.
+ File: `4-print_hexa.py`
